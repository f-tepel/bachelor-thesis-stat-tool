Both variables are influenced by price fluctuations. It is often assumed that price fluctuations are normally distributed. This allows analysts to calculate the probabilities that certain events will occur. For example, the probability that a security will fall by 10% within the next few days could be calculated. Using historical prices, the mean and standard deviation of price changes can be calculated. By applying the normal distribution and the calculations explained in this application, risks can then be quantified and investment decisions optimized.
